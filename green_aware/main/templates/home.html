    <h1>Welcome to Greenaware</h1>
    <p>
      Global warming is characterised as long-term changes to planetary average weather patterns (National
      Geographic, n.d.) which have significant effects on local, regional and global climates (Nasa.gov, n.d.). Global
      warming is driven by human activity - specifically, fossil fuel use resulting in increased greenhouse gas levels
      raising Earth’s average surface temperature (Nasa.gov, n.d.). Climate change caused by Global warming results
      in sea level changes linked to melting of polar ice sheets and glaciers causing widespread flooding and other
      forms of extreme weather such as intense droughts (National Geographic, n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this contrived scenario, a UK-based charity, Greenaware, is concerned with the climate changes caused by
      Global Warming. Greenaware’s mission is to collect data to improve awareness and drive predictive modelling
      initiatives with the overarching goals of supporting scientific research and affecting government policy.
      Greenaware’s services will allow climate-change conscious individuals and groups around the Earth to register
      and contribute by providing climate readings and observations related to their local regions at intervals.
      What3words a ‘proprietary geocode system designed to identify any location on the surface of Earth with a
      resolution of about 3 meters' (What3words, n.d.), will be used to convey precise geographic coordinates.
      Registered contributors, termed ‘Observers’ will first have to complete an online educational course before
      qualifying to contribute data. They will then be paid a monthly stipend to their accounts as a token of gratitude
      for their support.
